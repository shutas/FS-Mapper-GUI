Written by Shuta Suzuki (shutas@umich.edu)

## Overview
There are many scenarios where we want to pair a specific group of data with another group of data by mapping them using a common key.

This is a simple tool that given well-formatted input files and database files (see "Preparation" section for more information), it outputs the mapped version of input files.

## Requirements
#### Normal Users (Recommended):
- `Anaconda` with Python3.x (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

#### Developers:
- `Python3.x`
- `pip` to install dependencies such as `flask`, `pandas`, etc...
- `git` ...but you probably have it, right? ;)

## Installation
#### Normal Users (Recommended):
